<h3>About <span class="title">Advanced Linux Programming</span></h3>

<h4>Publication Information</h4>

<p><span class="title">Advanced Linux Programming</span><br>
by Mark Mitchell, Jeffrey Oldham, and Alex Samuel, of CodeSourcery LLC<br>
published by New Riders Publishing<br>
ISBN 0-7357-1043-0<br>
First Edition, June 2001</p>

<h4>From the Back Cover</h4>

<p><span class="title">Advanced Linux Programming</span> is intended for the
programmer already familiar with the C programming language.  Authors Alex
Samuel, Jeffrey Oldham, and Mark Mitchell of CodeSourcery, LLC take a tutorial
approach and teach the most important concepts and power features of the 
GNU/Linux system in application programs.</p>

<p>If you're a developer already experienced with programming for the GNU/Linux
system, are experienced with another UNIX-like system and are interested in
developing GNU/Linux software, or want to make the transition for a non-UNIX
environment and are already familiar with the general principles of writing
good software, this book is for you.  In addition, you will find that this book
is equally applicable to C and C++ programming.  Even those progamming in
other languages will find this book useful since the C language APIs and
conventions are the <i>lingua franca</i> of GNU/Linux.</p>

<h4>Endorsement</h4>

<p>By Adam Goodman, Publisher, 
<a href="http://www.linux-mag.com"><span class="title">Linux Magazine</span></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;As Linux becomes a more mainstream player in the internet infrastructure
market, there is a tremendous need for lucid programming texts that also convey
some of the philosophy behind the Linux and GNU movements.  This book does
an incredible job of covering all that.  I think it will be a standard against
which other introductory programming texts for Linux (and with all due respect
to Richard Stevens, possibly UNIX as well) are measured.&quot;
