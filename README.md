### From the Back Cover

Advanced Linux Programming is intended for the programmer already
familiar with the C programming language. Authors Alex Samuel, Jeffrey
Oldham, and Mark Mitchell of CodeSourcery, LLC take a tutorial
approach and teach the most important concepts and power features of
the GNU/Linux system in application programs.

If you're a developer already experienced with programming for the
GNU/Linux system, are experienced with another UNIX-like system and
are interested in developing GNU/Linux software, or want to make the
transition for a non-UNIX environment and are already familiar with
the general principles of writing good software, this book is for
you. In addition, you will find that this book is equally applicable
to C and C++ programming. Even those progamming in other languages
will find this book useful since the C language APIs and conventions
are the lingua franca of GNU/Linux.
